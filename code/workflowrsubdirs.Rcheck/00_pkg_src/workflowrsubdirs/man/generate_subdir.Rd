\usage{
generate_subdir(dir = "codeRmd", file_path = NULL, commit = F)
}
\arguments{
\item{dir}{character (default: "codeRmd").
Path to a directory, under a main workflowr subdirectory, where original Rmd files are saved.}

\item{file_path}{character (default: NULL).
Vector of paths to original .Rmd files. These file paths start with a name of the 1st subdirectory of a directory specified in variable "dir".
Example when directories subPagesX are saved in folder dir = "codeRmd": file_path = c("subPages2/testPrint2.Rmd", "subPages3/testPrint3.Rmd")}

\item{commit}{character (default: FALSE).
commit = TRUE creates a separate commit of temporary .Rmd files (temporary saved in directory "analysis").
Suggestion: Use commit = TRUE only after your original .Rmd files saved in subdirectories are tested properly and so are completely ready, otherwise you could have pointlessly many commits.}

\description{
This is one of functions serving as optional extension for workflowr package in order to be able to generate .html files from .Rmd files saved in subdirectories and not only in directory "analysis".
\code{generate_subdir} firstly generates temp_file names that are generated from the path were a relevant original .Rmd file is saved by substituing "/" to "--".
Then function \code{\link{generate_rmd}} is applied for all specified original .Rmd files (saved in subdirectories).
Finally, all temporary .Rmd files (containing "--") are deleted from directory "analysis".
If you want to use this function in other way than call it from \code{\link{generate_subdir}} then you have to set a correct workflowr project to be your working directory,
e.g. by running: setwd("D:/Cloud/Sync/Study/Programming/R/Work/Projects/GitHub/workflowrSubfolders")
