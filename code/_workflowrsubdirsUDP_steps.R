devtools::create("code/workflowrsubdirsUDP")
# Following message appears:
#   New project 'workflowrsubdirsUDP' is nested inside an existing project 'code/', which is rarely a good idea.
#   If this is unexpected, the here package has a function, `here::dr_here()` that reveals why 'code/' is regarded as a project.
#   Do you want to create anyway?

#   1: Negative
#   2: For sure
#   3: No way

#   Selection: 2

# step 2
# Close (click on the red x button in top right corner) a newly opened RStudio window.
# Create new .R files in directory "code/workflowrsubdirsUDP/R": generate.rmd.R, generate.subdir.R
# Create 1 function with 1 description per 1 .R file into these new .R files.

# I'm currently creating those functions and descriptions???
