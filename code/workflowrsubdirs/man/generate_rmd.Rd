\description{
This is one of functions serving as optional extension for workflowr package in order to be able to generate .html files from .Rmd files saved in subdirectories and not only in directory "analysis".
\code{generate_rmd} generates .Rmd files from original .Rmd files that are saved in subdirectories and save them into directory "analysis".
These generated .Rmd files are meant to be temporary and they will be deleted after \code{\link{generate_subdir}} generates final .html files.
