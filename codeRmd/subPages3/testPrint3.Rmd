This file in folder "subPages3" is for testing of half manual/automated workaround
to use package workflowr and sub-folders in folder "analysis".

call function from another file using argument "code" in the r chunk
```{r call_source, code = xfun::read_utf8(base::file.path(knitr::opts_knit$get("output.dir"),  "../code/subPages3/print3.R"))}
# used literature
# https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/option-code.html -> code option of an r chunk doesn't have disadvantages of the source() method
```

```{r additional_comment}
# [me:] Displaying comments for r chunk with argument "code" is not possible and has to be inserted into another r chunk.
```
